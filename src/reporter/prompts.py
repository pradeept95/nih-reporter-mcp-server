            1. Start with search_projects to get a quick preview of matching projects (samples first 500)
               - Returns total count and distributions (year, institute, activity code, organization, funding mechanism, active status, award stats)
               - Review distributions to understand the data landscape
               - To refine results, call search_projects again with filters added to search_params (years, agencies, activity_codes, states)
               - Repeat until the scope is appropriate for the query

            2. Use get_search_summary when you need accurate, complete statistics (e.g., "total funding for X")
               - Fetches ALL matching projects (not just a 500-result sample)
               - Use this for precise totals, not for exploration
               - May be slower for large result sets

            3. Use find_project_ids to get the list of project IDs for detailed queries
               - Returns up to 500 project IDs matching the search criteria

            4. Use get_project_information with only the IncludeFields needed to answer the query:
               - For funding questions: AWARD_AMOUNT, FISCAL_YEAR, DIRECT_COST_AMT, INDIRECT_COST_AMT
               - For PI questions: PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATORS, CONTACT_PI_NAME
               - For organization questions: ORGANIZATION, CONG_DIST, ORGANIZATION_TYPE
               - For grant type questions: ACTIVITY_CODE, FUNDING_MECHANISM, AGENCY_IC_ADMIN
               - Always include PROJECT_NUM for reference

            5. Use the returned information to answer the user's question."""

            Terms to search:

            Each response includes a `year_distribution` with the grant count per fiscal year for that term.

## Step 1: Fetch the cross-tabulation

Construct `search_params` from the filters described above, mapping them to the appropriate
`SearchParams` fields (e.g. `agencies`, `organizations`, `pi_name`, `activity_codes`,
`advanced_text_search`, etc.), then call `get_portfolio_crosstab` with:
- `row_field`: "fiscal_year"
- `col_field`: "activity_code"
- `years`: [{", ".join(years_list)}]
- Any additional fields derived from the filters

The response is a nested dict of `{{fiscal_year: {{activity_code: {{"count": N, "total_funding": X}}}}}}` covering all requested years.

## Step 2: Plot the results

Use Python (matplotlib or similar) to produce a stacked bar chart:
- X-axis: fiscal year
- Y-axis: number of grants (`count`) or total funding (`total_funding`) — choose based on context
- Each bar stacked by activity code
- Legend identifying each activity code
- Title: 'NIH Grant Counts by Activity Code' or 'NIH Total Funding by Activity Code'

Also display the raw counts in a table with one column per activity code:

| Fiscal Year | R01 | R21 | ... |
|-------------|-----|-----|-----|
| YYYY        | N   | N   | ... |"""
